    "course.6.exercise.title": "Exercise: Your Ladder of Thought Under the Magnifying Glass",
    "course.6.exercise.description": "Take a specific situation where you judged quickly. Consciously go through the ladder step by step: 1. Data (What objectively happened?). 2.

    "course.8.sections.0.content.0": "The label you give a state (e.g., 'stress' or 'excitement') shapes how you experience it. Because emotions are constructions, you can learn to offer your brain alternative interpretations.",

    "course.9.exercise.title": "Exercise: Train Your Growth Muscle",
    "course.9.exercise.description": "Choose a belief that sounds like a fixed mindset (e.g., 'I can't do that'). Rephrase it by adding '...yet' or turning it into a learning process. Say it out loud (e.g., 'I can't do that yet,' 'I'm currently learning to be more creative'). Feel the difference.",
